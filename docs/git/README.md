## About Git

Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub
related that happens locally on your computer.

- Created by Linus Torvalds,creator of Linux, in 2005.
  - Came out of Linux development community
  - Designed to do version control on Linux kernel
- Goals of Git:
  - Speed
  - Support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
  - Fully distributed
  - Able to handle large projects efficiently
  - (A "git" is a cranky old man. Linus meant himself.)
